# Spotify Recommendations
Interact with Spotify's API through the command line to get music recommendations based on your preferences.

Run this file in the command line as follows:
```
$ python music_finder.py
```
The user can input integers to choose options from the main menu. These include selecting genres, artists, and tracks which are used as seed parameters in fetching song recommendations. 

After accruing as many as five genres, artists, or tracks (in total), the user can choose the penultimate option to discover new music. This prints Spotify's track recommendations to standard output. 

The user also has the option to save an HTML file containing these recommendations to the program directory and/or email the recommendations to themselves or others.
